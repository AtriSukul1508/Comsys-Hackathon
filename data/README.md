## Task A: Gender Classification

**Objective:** Predict the gender (male/female) of a subject from a face image captured under visually degraded conditions. This is a binary classification problem.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score

## Task B: Face Recognition

**Objective:** Assign each face image to a correct person identity from a known set of individuals. This is a multi-class classification problem.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
* Top-1 Accuracy
* Macro-averaged F1-Score
